The navigation systems used in Google Maps, Ola, and Uber primarily rely on satellites that are part of **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)**. These satellites provide location data essential for accurate mapping and navigation. The most commonly used satellite systems for this purpose include:

### 1. **GPS (Global Positioning System)**
   - **Owned by:** United States Government
   - **Details:** GPS is the most widely used navigation satellite system. It provides highly accurate positioning and timing information globally. GPS satellites orbit at an altitude of about 20,200 km.
   - **Applications:** Google Maps, Ola, Uber, and most other navigation systems heavily depend on GPS.

### 2. **GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System)**
   - **Owned by:** Russia
   - **Details:** Similar to GPS, GLONASS offers global coverage. It is often used in conjunction with GPS to improve accuracy in navigation, particularly in areas where GPS signals might be weak.
   - **Applications:** Many modern smartphones and apps integrate both GPS and GLONASS for better reliability.

### 3. **Galileo**
   - **Owned by:** European Union
   - **Details:** This system offers precise location services with a focus on high accuracy. Galileo is increasingly being integrated into smartphones and navigation systems for redundancy and improved accuracy.
   - **Applications:** Supported by newer devices and maps for enhanced precision.

### 4. **BeiDou (BDS)**
   - **Owned by:** China
   - **Details:** BeiDou is China's GNSS and provides global coverage. It is becoming more popular as it is integrated into more devices, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.
   - **Applications:** Some modern navigation systems use BeiDou in combination with GPS.

### 5. **IRNSS/NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System)**
   - **Owned by:** India
   - **Details:** NavIC is primarily focused on providing regional coverage over India and surrounding areas. It is used to enhance location accuracy within its operational range.
   - **Applications:** Certain smartphones and navigation systems in India support NavIC for better regional precision.

### Combined Usage
Modern navigation devices and applications like Google Maps often use **multi-GNSS receivers** that integrate data from multiple satellite systems (e.g., GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou). This ensures greater accuracy, reliability, and redundancy, particularly in urban environments with signal obstructions caused by tall buildings.


The satellites used for navigation systems like **GPS**, **GLONASS**, **Galileo**, **BeiDou**, and **NavIC** primarily operate in the **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)** category, which lies between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Here's the breakdown:

---

### **1. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)**
   - **Altitude Range:** ~2,000 km to ~35,786 km
   - **Used By:** 
     - **GPS**: Altitude ~20,200 km
     - **GLONASS**: Altitude ~19,100 km
     - **Galileo**: Altitude ~23,222 km
     - **BeiDou MEO satellites**: Altitude ~21,528 km
     - **NavIC (for its navigation satellites)**: Some satellites operate in MEO (~36,000 km)
   - **Why MEO?**
     - Provides a good balance between coverage and accuracy.
     - Satellites in MEO cover a larger portion of the Earth's surface compared to LEO but don't have the latency of GEO.
     - Ideal for global navigation systems since fewer satellites are needed for continuous coverage.

---

### **2. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)**
   - **Altitude Range:** Exactly ~35,786 km
   - **Used By:** 
     - Some BeiDou satellites (BeiDou also includes GEO satellites as part of its hybrid constellation).
     - NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) has a mix of MEO and GEO satellites.
   - **Why GEO?**
     - GEO satellites remain fixed relative to a point on Earth, which is useful for regional navigation systems like NavIC and BeiDou.
     - Typically used in regional navigation and communication systems rather than global navigation.

---

### **3. Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**
   - **Altitude Range:** ~200 km to ~2,000 km
   - **Used By:** Not commonly used for navigation satellites, but LEO satellites are employed for:
     - Earth observation (e.g., weather and imaging satellites).
     - Communication systems like Starlink or OneWeb.
   - **Why not for GNSS?**
     - LEO satellites have a limited coverage area and require a large constellation for global coverage, making them less ideal for navigation systems.

---

### Summary
- **GNSS systems like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou mostly use MEO.**
- **Regional systems like NavIC and parts of BeiDou also utilize GEO.**
- **LEO is generally not used for navigation purposes.**
